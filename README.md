# HW2 - The VBA of Wall Street

Stock Market Data Analysis using VBA scripting.

## Important Information

This VBA script creates a loop that will go through all the stocks for one year and take the following information:

-The ticker symbol.<br>
-Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.<br>
-The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.<br>
-The total stock volume of the stock.<br>

Additionally, the code includes conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Based on the challenge portion of the analysis, additional code was added to allow the script to run on every worksheet (every year of data), just by running it once.
